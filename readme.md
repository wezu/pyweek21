To run the game:

1. Double click game.exe
2. That's it!

-on Linux and/or Mac:
1. Download the Panda3D runtime from:
https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?runtime
2. Install the runtime .. the usuall way you install things on your OS
3. Double click  game.p3d
4. That's it!

To run the game from source (main.py) you need to install the Panda3D SDK 1.9.1 or greater from:
https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?sdk

The game needs a GPU and drivers (!) capable of rendering OpenGL 3.2 !

Controls:
WSAD - movment
SPACE - jump/reset car if upsidedown
TAB - exit/enter car (must be close to car to enter)
SHIFT - turn the mower blade on/off (higher fuel consumption!)
F1 - in game help
ESC - exit

Gamplay:
There is none. Due to time limits the game has no goal.
Run or drive around, cut some grass... and wait a month or so for me to make this into a real game ;)
